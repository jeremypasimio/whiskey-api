This is an in-development prototype API to support functionality of a whiskey knowledge database. 

There is a vast community of whiskey lovers that enjoy tasting and collecting whiskies. One of the important aspects of tasting whisky is to take notes of a tasting to record the experience for future reference. Longterm, the goal is to develop a web app to allow users to record tasting notes, pictures, and personal collection information. Having a database of basic information for as many whiskies as possible would help make the user's experience better, as the likelihood of having to manually enter all the information would be greatly reduced. This would allow the user to focus on recording their experience rather than having to do data entry. This API,when complete, will facilitate the development of this web app. Even further down the line, it will be expanded to perform comparable data access for other categories of consumables such as coffee, beer, wine, cigars, etc.
